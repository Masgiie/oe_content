# Document reference entity type

The "Document reference" entity type allows editors to reference documents in different ways, for example:
- A document attached to a publication node
- A media asset of type "Document"

At the moment, this module provides the following bundles:
- Document: can reference medias of type "Document".
- Publication: can reference nodes of type "Publication".

When used on a [entity reference revision](https://www.drupal.org/project/entity_reference_revisions) field, in combination with the [inline entity form](https://www.drupal.org/project/inline_entity_form) widget, the "Document reference" entity type brings the additional value of being able to arrange heterogeneous document references (as in: references to different entity types) in the needed order.

# Document reference entity type

The "Document reference" entity type allows editors to reference documents in different ways, for example:
- A document attached to a publication node
- A media asset of type "Document"

At the moment, this module provides the following bundles:
- Document: can reference medias of type "Document".
- Publication: can reference nodes of type "Publication".

When used on a entity reference field, in combination with the Inline Entity Form module, the "Document reference" entity type brings the additional value of being able to arrange references to different types of documents as needed.

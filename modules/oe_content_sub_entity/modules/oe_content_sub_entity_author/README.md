# Author entity type

At the moment, this module provides the following bundles:
- "Corporate body" with possibility to reference some corporate body term.

When used on a [entity reference revision](https://www.drupal.org/project/entity_reference_revisions) field, in combination with the [inline entity form](https://www.drupal.org/project/inline_entity_form) widget, the "Author" entity type brings the additional value of being able to arrange heterogeneous author references (as in: references to different entity types and bundle) in the needed order.

# Corporate Organisation entity type

The Organisation entity type is used when collecting information about different types of organisations.

In order for users to view, edit or delete organisations you need to explicitly grant them the right permissions.

The module provides the following permissions:

- `Organisation: Access canonical page`
- `Organisation: Access overview page`
- `Organisation: View any published entity`
- `Organisation: View any unpublished entity`

Grant the `Organisation: View any published entity` permission to the anonymous user role in order to allow your
site's visitors to view organisation entities.

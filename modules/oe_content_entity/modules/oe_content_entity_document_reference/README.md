# Corporate Document reference entity type

The Document reference entity type is used as an intermediate when reference to the entity types of different types has to be set in one field.

This module provides the following bundles:

- Document - provides the field to reference the media Document.
- Publication - provides the field to reference the node Publication.

In order for users to view, edit or delete document references you need to explicitly grant them the right permissions.

The module provides the following permissions:

- `Document reference: Access canonical page`
- `Document reference: Access overview page`
- `Document reference: Create new Document entity`
- `Document reference: Create new Publication entity`
- `Document reference: Edit any Document entity`
- `Document reference: Edit any Publication entity`
- `Document reference: Delete any Document entity`
- `Document reference: Delete any Publication entity`
- `Document reference: View any published entity`
- `Document reference: View any unpublished entity`

Grant the `Document reference: View any published entity` permission to the anonymous user role in order to allow your
site's visitors to view document reference entities.

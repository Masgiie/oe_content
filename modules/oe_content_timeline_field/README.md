# OpenEuropa Timeline field

This module provides the Timeline field definition with a custom widget and formatter.
It provides a basic twig template for rendering, but it is meant to be overridden by oe_theme that brings
the Europa Component Library (ECL) and provides the front-end for the timeline component.
